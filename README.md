## Music app
Hey, this was a music app I was working on, still working on. It was originally gonna be like a spotify clone that pulled up lyrics, but had to scrap that unfortunately and now I have this app. While it is unfinshed currently which multiple problems, I'ma still try to work on this and update it when I can. This has me stressed out and losing sleep trying to get this finished and I still didn't get it finished.


## Motivation
I wanted to do a music app and player, but tried a api that needed a premium account which was terrible. I had an idea to do, but I kept running into api problems which resulted in this unfisnished app.

## Access
If you want to load this site to your computer you need to fork and clone this repo:
Frontend - [https://github.com/https://github.com/BlountIV/music-app-frontend]
Backend - [https://github.com/https://github.com/BlountIV/music-app-backend]
 
## Unsolved Problems
- Submit button for editing songs don't work, the images for the song you click on doesn't show which I had trouble trying to figure out how that worked. Also the song was supposed to load too but couldn't figure out how to get it to work too.

## Future Enhancements
- There are a plethora of things I would love to add to this app in the future, such as:
- A music player with functions to play songs, a library to see music, and probably a background gif, some type of motion photo, or video so you don't have to look at a still photo for the songs

## Tech/framework used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- React
- Express 
- Mongo DB
- Mongoose
- Node.js
- GitHub

## How to use?
- So this isn't finished, but if you wanted to try it out, just download music and some images to add to this app via the create on the main page of the app.
- There is an option when you click a song in the list to edit which you can change the image for the song and song file, if you have any on your pc/laptop/phone, but like I said, this isn't finished.
- You can delete a song from the list, thankfully that works haha "sweating"
- This express application will automatically update your new destination in the Mongo Database
- Lastly the images and song is supposed to be played when you click a song, but the functionality hasn't been worked out yet.
